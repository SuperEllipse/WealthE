    label: finbot-ollama
    short_description: |
      Dhan stands for Wealth in Sanksrit. This AMP uses the increasingly popular Ollama service to create self-hosted LLM Bot on a localized environment. It uses a
      ChatGPT style interface that holds the memory of earlier questions. We also use Trulens, a framework to evaluate the performance of LLM
      responses
